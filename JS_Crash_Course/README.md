# JavaScript Tutorials

The e4c basic JavaScript training uses the 
[JavaScript Crash Course For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} 
by Traversy Media

For these exercises I used the following:

1. VSCode
2. Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey
3. Downloaded index.html and style.css from the comments below the video
4. JSDoc installed via npm for Windows.
5. DocDash plugin installed via npm for Windows.  
6. JSDoc to Markdown plugin installed via npm for Windows.

NOTE: The default installation for DocDash did not work properly.  I had to copy the docdash,
jsdoc and the jsdoc-to-markdown directories from 

C:\Users\rober\AppData\Roaming\nvm\v22.3.0\node_modules
<br>to
<br>C:\Users\rober\AppData\Roaming\nvm\v22.3.0\node_modules\jsdoc\node_modules

This is probably a path/configuration problem with my npm setup.
