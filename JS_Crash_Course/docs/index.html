NOTE: This also contains examples of my default coding style.  The first is to 
flatten or "one-line" simple if statements.  I feel devoting entire lines to 
opening and closing punctuation to be a waste of screen real estate unless they
are blocking of larger sections of code.
<p>
I also tend to align punctuation and other markers such as opening and closing
braces, equalit comparisons, etc.  This is done because, especially on one-line
type statements the difference between the 'if' and and the 'else' can be subtle.
This alignment usually makes it easier to distinguish the difference.
<p>
Finally, when I have a complex 'if' directive, I tend to put them on separate lines
and align them.  Again, I simply feel this is more readable.
