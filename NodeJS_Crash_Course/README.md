# NodeJS Tutorials

## Comments

I already had a little bit of NodeJS experience so this went pretty quick.  However, I've not
actually built a server, just used it.  So that part was new, even though they did not go 
very deep into that.

server.js has both the http server part as well as the first part of the video which modified
a local file.

I did not however do the part about deploying to Heroku.

## Training Materials

The e4c basic NodeJS training uses the [Node.js Crash Course for Beginners Tutorial - Learn Node Basics in 30 Minutes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LUdnb-mls0) by codeSTACKr

## Setup

IDE used was VSCode.  NodeJS, NPM and NodeMon were all installed as described in the video.  JSDoc
was used to document it with a README.md used by GitPgaes.
